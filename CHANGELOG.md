# Changelog

## [1.0.1] - UI Overhaul & Cleanup
- Fully redesigned layout replacing the split-pane with a modern, compact single-column approach matching the D&D 5e Book FANG Theme.

- Fixed missing localization keys in `de.json` and `en.json` for the configure/control panels.

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release
- Brand new module! Renamed from experimental "ninjos-player-wheel" to "Ninjo's Player Wheel".
- Full integration with Foundry VTT settings to track players.
- Added visual and auditory celebratory feedback when a player is selected.
- Compatibility with Monk's Common Display for full party viewing.
- Implemented auto-reset behavior when all players have spun the wheel.
- German and English localization.
